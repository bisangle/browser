# UXSS via ContainerNode::parserRemoveChild

### Reported by <mailto:lokihardt@google.com>, Feb 2 2017

This is a regression test from https://crbug.com/456518.

ContainerNode::parserRemoveChild doesn't detach subframes unlike ContainerNode::removeChild. As a result, it could lead to UXSS.

Tested on Safari 10.0.3(12602.4.8).
