# [CVE-2014-1315] OSX Safari uncontrolled format string

> This one is for OS X Safari, so not exactly in our main field of interest, but it's really funny:

```

> CoreServicesUIAgent responsible for the format string vulnerability was fixed in OS X Mavericks 10.9.2 (Mountain Lion and previous were not affected). Exploitability was not confirmed on our side, however Apple states that it could result in arbitrary code execution. Hats off to Erik Kooistra, who reported this vulnerability independently (before I did).
