# Security: Cross-site read access to PDF files

> Reported by rob@robwu.nl, Aug 13 2015

## SUMMARY

The out-of-process viewer exposes an API when its MIME-type is set to application/x-google-chrome-pdf, presumably to support the print preview.

Among the supported API is a method to select all text and get the contents of the selection. This allows any web page to read the contents of a PDF file from any source.

I have attached a proof of concept.

1. Open the page.
2. Input the URL of a PDF file (I've used the Bitcoin paper as an example).
3. Click on the "Show content" button.
4. The contens of the PDF will be displayed in the text field.

This can be fully automated, websites could scan for popular URLs and automatically read the contents of a PDF. The only defence for users is to disable plugin loading by default. There are three settings, "Run all plugin content", "Detect and run important plugin content" and "Let me choose when to run plugin content". Only the last option protects users from this exploit.
