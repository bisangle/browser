# Universal XSS via the interception of |Binding| with Object.prototype.create

> Reported by <mailto:marius.mlynski@gmail.com>, Mar 26 2016

## VULNERABILITY DETAILS

The fix for issue 590118 is insufficient to protect against bindings interception. While they can't be accessed by triggering accessors on the |modules| object anymore, it's still possible to trap the set operation for |Binding.create| using Object.prototype.create. The obtained constructor can then be used to take over the the built-in extensions system and gain access to native functions.
