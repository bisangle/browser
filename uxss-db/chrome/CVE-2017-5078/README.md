# Security: DoCanonicalizeMailtoURL() fails to canonicalize characters leading to command injection

> Reported by jose.car...@gmail.com, Apr 12 2017

## Summary 


```
When Google Chrome call to mailto protocol on Unix it call via xdg-email which is a bash script, Google Chrome don't sanitize the * and when Bash interpret it expand it as directory.

This issue was tested in other browser as Firefox and the * is not expanded showing the char *.

The next proof of concept shows how expand in bash when Google Chrome call it and how in other browsers dont works.

This can allow on some conditions to exfiltrate de directory of the user.
