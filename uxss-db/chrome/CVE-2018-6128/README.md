# Security: uXSS in Chrome on iOS

> Reported by th...@inbox.com, May 9

## VULNERABILITY DETAILS

Universal XSS by using "..;@" within the url :~D

## VERSION

Chrome Version: [66.0.3359.122] + [stable]  
Operating System: [iOS]

## REPRODUCTION CASE

Basically if we run this javascript code " history.replaceState('','','..;@www.google.com:%3443/') " from any domain using "HTTPS:" our URL domain is being replaced to that one..

For example: if this code is run on my site https://web-safety.net/ the the url is being replaced to https://www.google.com yet the contents remain under my control.. Therefore etc. we can run unrestricted XHR requests as long as the path is not absolute ('../myAccountInfo','../../SomeOtherSensitiveInformation')

Proof of Concept displaying Cookies in an iframe from https://www.google.com

This should work fine on any iOS on Chrome
