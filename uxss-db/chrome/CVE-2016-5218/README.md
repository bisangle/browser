# Security: Temporary addressbar spoof with PDF navigation to sites with long response time

> Reported by greencar...@hotmail.com, Oct 28 2016

## VULNERABILITY DETAILS

On Chrome Version 54.0.2840.71 m (64-bit), I was able to spoof 'https://www.facebook.com:81' for a good few seconds. We are able to modify the document and its title right before loading which could make it seem like the page navigated.

The same method could (theoretically) be used on web servers with a way to perform a DoS. Say 'https://www.facebook.com/someFile?some.function' is vulnerable to a DoS attack where the response takes a longer time than usual, then we can use this trick to spoof that URI as well. Naturally a DDoS attack could work as well (which are pretty common these days)

Also, the document is active during this spoof which means we can have the user submit a fake login for example.

Potential fix: Do not change the URI on drag and drop, or at least set the document to 'about:blank' when this happens.
